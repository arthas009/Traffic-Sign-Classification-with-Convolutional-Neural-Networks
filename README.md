Traffic Sign Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras

# About withCNN.py
This is the file of building and training a CNN model.
You must set all data paths according to your own train/test locations.

# About my_model.h5
CNN ready model. You can use this .h5 file if you directly load it on your project. Test accuracy = %94

# About GUI
You can make a simple application using the python codes in GUI folder. To test the model we built, specify a image path and wait for the prediction result :)


You can find a dataset for traffic signs here. https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/. Belgium Traffic Signs Dataset for 62 different sign which I used in this project.
AFTER 50 EPOCH %99 TRAIN AND %96 VALIDATION ACCURACY.
